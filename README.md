# MassBias
An end-to-end tool that takes a halo catalog a produces a mass bias P(M_true| O), where O is some cluster observable (mass, richness, Compton Y, etc.).

For details about what this tool does, see `docs/info.pdf`.

For my benefit, the order to run these as scripts are: catalog.py, converter.py, and then fitter.py.
